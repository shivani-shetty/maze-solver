# 🕵️‍♂️ Pathfinding Visualizer

A web-based **pathfinding visualizer** that demonstrates popular pathfinding algorithms like **DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, and A\* Search**. This interactive tool allows users to set a start and end point, place obstacles, and visualize how different algorithms find the shortest path.

You can find the web app on  https://shivani-shetty.github.io/maze-solver/#
